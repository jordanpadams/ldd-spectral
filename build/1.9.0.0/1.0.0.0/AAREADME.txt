Spectral Dictionary Package
===========================

  NOTE: The 1.9.0.0 version of the Spectral Dictionary is identical to the
        1.10.0.0 version except for the IM version referenced.

This package contains the input Ingest_LDD file, the output schema files and
label produced by LDDTool, two test labels to exercise various Spectral
Dictionary features, a null data file to satisfy referential integrity
validation, and a validation report for the two test labels. Only the schema
files are necessary to use Spectral Dictionary classes in product labels;
the other files are supplied for users who are interested in the details of
dictionary development and definition.

In the following descriptions, "IM" refers to the PDS4 Information Model.

The files included are:

AAREADME.txt

  This file.

No.Data

  This is a placeholder file that prevents "File not found"-type referential
  integrity errors when running the Validate Tool on the test labels.
  
PDS4_SP_1900.sch
PDS4_SP_1900.xsd
PDS4_SP_1900.xml

  These three files are part of the output producted by running the 8.0.0
  version of LDDTool (built incorporating the 1.9.0.0 version IM) on
  the "SpectraLDD.xml" input file, using the command line:
  
    % lddtool -lps SpectraLDD.xml
  
SpectralDDTest1.xml

  A test label that references the 1.9.0.0 Version of the IM and the Spectral
  Dictionary.  This label should show no validation errors.
  
  NOTE: This label is not "valid" in the sense that it does not show a real-
        data use of the Spectral Dictionary classes; but it does demonstrate
        the basic techniques for associating spectral characteristics to
        data structures of the supported types.
  
SpectralDDTest2.xml

  A test label that references the 1.9.0.0 Version of the IM and the Spectral
  Dictionary.  This label shows a number of validation errors, which should
  correspond to the comments in the label.
  
SpectraLDD.xml

  This is the input Ingest_LDD structure that defines the Spectral Dictionary
  content.  It is heavily annotated to explain the various techniques used.
  
validation.rpt

  This is the validation report for the two test labels generated by running
  the 1.13.0 version of the Validate Tool with the following command line:
  
    % validate -t SpectralDDTest1.xml, SpectralDDTest2.xml -f -D > validation.rpt
    
  [Note that the "-f" option forces Validate Tool to seek the online version
  of the referenced schemas listed in the label file for use in validation.]
