Spectral Dictionary Package
===========================
Updated 2019-03-29, ACR.

This package contains the input Ingest_LDD file, the output schema files and
label produced by LDDTool, two test labels to exercise various Spectral
Dictionary features, a null data file to satisfy referential integrity
validation, and a validation report for the two test labels. Only the schema
files are necessary to use Spectral Dictionary classes in product labels;
the other files are supplied for users who are interested in the details of
dictionary development and definition.

In the following descriptions, "IM" refers to the PDS4 Information Model; 
the version number "1.10.0.0" is indicated in file names as "1A00".

The files included are:

AAREADME.txt

  This file.

No.Data

  This is a placeholder file that prevents "File not found"-type referential
  integrity errors when running the Validate Tool on the test labels.
  
PDS4_SP_1A00_1100.sch
PDS4_SP_1A00_1100.xsd
PDS4_SP_1A00_1100.xml

  These three files are part of the output producted by running the 8.1.0
  version of LDDTool (built incorporating the 1.10.0.0 version IM) on
  the "SpectraLDD-1A00_1100.xml" input file, using the command line:
  
    % lddtool -lps SpectraLDD.xml
  
SP-Test1-VALID.xml
SP-Test2-VALID.xml

  Two test labels that reference the 1.10.0.0 version of the IM and the 
  Spectral Dictionary version 1.1.0.0.  These labels should show no 
  validation errors.
  
  NOTE: The labels are not "valid" in the sense that they do not show a real-
        data use of the Spectral Dictionary classes; but they do demonstrate
        the basic techniques for associating spectral characteristics to
        data structures of the supported types.
  
SP-Test1-FAIL.xml
SP-Test2-FAIL.xml

  Test labels nearly identical to their "*-VALID" counterparts, but which have
  had specific, documented errors inserted into them to demonstrate that 
  particular features are being validated.
  
SpectraLDD-1A00_1100.xml

  This is the input Ingest_LDD structure that defines the Spectral Dictionary
  content.  It is heavily annotated to explain the various techniques used.
  
val.config
validate.rpt

  The configuration file and validation report generated by running this
  command:
  
     % validate -config val.config
     
  The version of Validate Tool used, which affects the availability of core
  information model versions, is listed at the top of the validate.rpt file.
