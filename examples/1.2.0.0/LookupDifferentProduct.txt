Spectral Dictionary Code Sample: Lookup in a Different Product

This file shows example sections of a (fake) label to illustrate how to use 
the "Lookup" option to identify bin parameters that are in another data 
product in the PDS.  This method can be used with any type of spectrum, 
though it is most frequently used in conjunction with array-type spectra. 
Note that standard validation cannot ensure that the dimensions of the 
referenced objects match the dimensions of the spectral object, so data 
preparers and reviewers should take special note.

The example below is for a 3D spectral array where the spectral dimension
is in frequency, but may be used with any valid spectral_bin_type.  In this
case, the bin center map is in a different product. This technique is most
often used when the bin center/width map is constant across many observations.

This example also shows how to use the Bin_Width_Constant class within the
Spectral_Lookup option.  When a width map is also available, it would, of
course, be referenced in the appropriate way.

The Spectral_Characteristics class appears in the <Discipline_Area> of the  
label.  Classes within the Spectral_Characteristics that are required to be 
present but not relevant to specifying bin parameters are elided.

Here is a mock-up of the corresponding Array_3D_Spectrum class.  (The referenced
center and width maps would be in different products with appropriate definitions.)
In this case the use of <Display_Direction> for all objects in all products is
strongly advised, to ensure that the bin centers and widths are properly mapped to 
the correct plane and orientation from the spectral cube.
