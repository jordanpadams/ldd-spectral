# Spectral Discipline Dictionary - Code Samples

This directory provides some coded examples of how to use various techniques available in the Spectral Dictionary. 
These code samples are not intended to represent any real or even plausible data.
The code samples are not intended to present recommendations or best practices for labelling 
data outside of the <Spectral_Characteristics> class and its attributes. In fact, the object 
descriptions provided for context do not, in general, meet even the minimal levels of detail 
required for archival data.

Code samples are provided for the most recent version of the dictionary, 1.2.0.0. Samples are
presented as text files with commentary introducing the samples.  Comments within the samples are 
indicated by using the XML comment markers, "&lt;!-- --&gt;".

## Example Files

The following files are provided:
