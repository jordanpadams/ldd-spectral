Spectral Dictionary Code Sample: Uniformly Sampled Bins

This file shows example sections of a (fake) label to illustrate how to use 
the "Uniformly Sampled" option to define spectral bin centers and widths for
a 2D spectrum.  This method assumes that the bin widths are constant in the
scale of the sampling interval.

The example below is for an Array_2D_Spectrum where the spectral dimension 
is wavelength.  The appropriate unit-specific classes would be used for 
wavenumber and frequency spectra.  (So Uniformly_Sampled_Frequency, etc.
would be used for a frequency spectrum, for example.) The Uniformly Sampled
method can be used with arrays and with 1D spectral tables (in which each 
row of the table corresponds to one bin).

The Spectral_Characteristics class appears in the <Discipline_Area> of the  
label.  Classes within the Spectral_Characteristics that are required to be 
present but not relevant to specifying bin parameters are elided.

Here is a mock-up of the corresponding Array_2D_Spectrum object.  Note that
the <local_identifier> value is identical to that referenced in the 
Local_Internal_Reference class at the top of the Spectral_Characteristics. 
Also note that the second axis <axis_name> value corresponds to the
axis_name in the Uniformly_Sampled_Wavelength class above.
